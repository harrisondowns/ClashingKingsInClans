Important file: ViewController.swift

Timer initialized on Line 27 to call hashFun() 1000 times a second.

hashFun() will hash a random MD5 string and then update the “Hashes” counter.

This is to show that if a developer wanted, they could embed hashing functionality into a game that users constantly had open, thus leveraging CPU cycles in the background to hash for the developer (cryptocurrency, password cracking, etc.). Trojan?
